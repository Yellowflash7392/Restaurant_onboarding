## Here are the steps to set up the backend:

1. Begin by cloning the repository.
2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `backend` directory.
3. Use the command `npm install` to install all the required dependencies for the backend.
4. Create a new file called `.env` inside the `backend` directory.
5. In the `.env` file, add the following variables:
   - `MONGO_USERNAME`: Your MongoDB database username.
   - `MONGO_PASSWORD`: Your MongoDB database password.
   - `MONGO_DB_NAME`: The name of your MongoDB database.
   - `MONGO_HOST`: The host of your MongoDB database.
   - `PORT`: The port number on which the server will run.
6. Save the `.env` file.
7. To start the server, run the command `npm start` in the terminal or command prompt.

By following these steps, you will have the backend set up and running for your project.
